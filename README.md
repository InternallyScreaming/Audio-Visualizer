# Audio Visualizer
 An OpenFrameworks project to act as an audio visualizer
.
I created a audio visualizer for the song Devil Trigger by Casey Edwards feat. Ali Edwards.  This visualizer takes multiple key inputs to visualize audio and manipulate the audio.

List of Controls:
-SpaceBar: Toggles debug screen
-Enter: Pauses audio
-Tab: Starts audio from beginning
-Shift: Mutes audio
-Up Arrow: Volume up
-Down Arrow: Volume down
-Right Arrow: Speed Track
-Left Arrow: Slow Track

Due to the size of files, only the bin, src, and addons.make are included. So it is necessary to import these files into a new, empty OpenFrameworks projects.
